2022 - Linux-basic-fundementals-notes:

1. /etc - Extended text configuration

File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) - defines the required directory structure and contents for Linux systems. /
E.g. when it comes to troubleshooting in a real world scenario, you might be expected to to view and monitor the system logs.

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) - When it comes to describing open source software with no license costs.

----------------Commands in Linux ----------------
man ¬ help me, man. Command to get help with different commands related to the Linux command. When using the man command, you type in -> man [command name].
help e.g. (cp --help) ¬ It will only display a list of the common options & arguments to a command.
ls ¬ Shows the all contents in the current directory.
ls -l (long listing) ¬ List the contents of the current directory with more details.
ls -a (include hidden) ¬ List all objects of the current directory.
ls -al (long listing + hidden) ¬ List all objects of the current directory with more details.
pwd ¬ Shows the current location of the directory.
cp ¬ Copy the current files or directories. to copy newfile.txt into newdir -> cp [file name] [newdir]
cd ¬ Change to another directory.
touch ¬ Creates an empty file. On an existing file, the file’s contents won’t be changed, but the files modification timestamp will be updated.
mkdir ¬ Command is used to create directories.
mv ¬ Moving files. To move a file to Desktop directory -> mv [filename.txt] Desktop/
rm ¬ Deleting & removing files. To remove a file -> rm [textname.txt]
rmdir ¬ To remove directory (and it removes files at the same time) -> rmdir [command].
rm -r ¬ Deletes any directories, but everything within that directory, including subdirectories and their contents.

----------------Basic System Administration ----------------
cat /etc/passwd - Shows the current users information (pass will be encrypted).
sudo useradd [username] - Adds the user to the system, you must give sudo permission to be able to create the new user.
sudo userdel [username] - Deletes the user from the system. You must give sudo permission to be able to delete the user.
sudo passwd [username] - Creates a password for the specific selected user.
sudo groupadd [groupname] - Adds the group to the system.
sudo groupdel [groupname] - Deletes the group from the system. You must give sudo permission to be able to delete the group.
cat /etc/group - Shows the current groups information in the system.
sudo usermod -G [groupname] [username] - Adds selected user to the group.
sudo userdel [username] [groupname] - Deletes the selected user from selected specific group

Octals values of file permission & directories:

----------------Permissions on Files ----------------
r - Stands for read and has an octal value of 4.
w - Stands for write and has an octal value of 2.
x - Stands for write and has an octal value of 1.

---------------- Permissions on Directories ----------------
r - This means permission to read the directory’s contents, like filenames.
w - This means permission to create or delete files in a directory, or change their names, permissions and owners.
x - This means permission to enter a directory, but not to list its files (for that, the r permission is needed).

Example:
chmod +rwx [directoryname] to add permissions
chmod -rwx [directoryname] to remove permissions. 
chmod +x [filename] to allow executable permissions.
chmod -wx [filename] to take out write and executable permissions.

---------------- Permission group ----------------
Owners: these permissions will only apply to owners and will not affect other groups.
Groups: you can assign a group of users specific permissions, which will only impact users within the group.
All users: these permissions will apply to all users, and as a result, they present the greatest security risk and should be assigned with caution.

Example:
chmod g+w [filename]
chmod g-wx [filename]
chmod o+w [filename]
chmod o-rwx [foldername]

To change directory permissions for everyone, use “u” for users, “g” for group, “o” for others, and “ugo” or “a” (for all).
chmod ugo+rwx [foldername] - To give read, write, and execute to everyone.
chmod a=r [foldername] - To give only read permission for everyone.

----------------File & Directory Owenership ----------------
chown - Is used to modify the ownership of a file or directory.
sytax: chown [username]:[groupname] [filename]

example: The user who's owns the file is "tester" and the group is "root".
$ ls -l ossec.conf
-rw-rw---- 1 tester root 5782 Sep 3 16:27 ossec.conf (what it shows to the user on the screen)

To modify the owner of the group syntax:
group1:
sudo chown root:group1 ossec.conf

---------------- Virtual Linux ----------------
---------------- What is Virtualization? ----------------
In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and computer resources”. 

Virtualization can be achieved at different hardware and software layers, CPU, storage, RAM, filesystems, etc. A Virtual Machine, or “VM” represents an isolated collection of emulated resources, behaving like an actual physical system.
VMs are created with the help of a hypervisor, that runs on a host machine.
Type-1 hypervisor: 
This type of hypervisor runs directly on top of a physical host machine’s hardware, without the need for a host OS. Typically, they are found in enterprise settings. 
- IBM z/VM
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Nutanix AHV
- Oracle VM Server for SPARC
- Oracle VM Server for x86
- VMware ESXi
- AWS Nitro
- Xen
Type-2 hypervisor:
This type of hypervisor runs on top of the host’s OS.
- VirtualBox
- VMware Player

---------------- What is VirtualBox? ----------------
VirtualBox is an x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product from Oracle, running on Windows, Linux, etc.
It is an easy-to-use multi-platform type-2 hypervisor. Although not part of the mainline Linux kernel it can be used by compiling and inserting the respective kernel module.
Benefits of Using VirtualBox:
- It’s open source
- It is free to use.
- It can run on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and Solaris.
- It provides two virtualization choices: software-based virtualization and hardware-assisted virtualization.
- It is an easy-to-use multi-platform type-2 hypervisor.
